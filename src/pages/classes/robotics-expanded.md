# Robotics Expanded
In Introduction to Robotics, we’ve guided you through a variety of useful and challenging activities, building and tweaking mechanisms that have already been designed. Now is your chance to build something never seen before, and design your own creation. We’ll be there to guide you along the way.

Sensors, motors, and computers are just as fundamental to modern society as simple machines were to society a century ago. Introduction to Robotics will teach you about basic robot components and serve as a guide to bringing your creations to life. In it, we will explore how to integrate electronics into our designs, and use programming to control them.

### Pricing
More details are to come.
* $95 to rent
* $500 to buy
* $12-20 per child per lesson hour

## Curriculum
There’s no rigid timeline, as we don’t know what you’ll build! Instead, we will be limiting the course to six weeks, and providing challenges for you to design a robot to tackle. Choose one of the challenges and go for it!

## Challenges

### Search and Shoot

This is a programming-oriented challenge. Modify the Shooterbot to autonomously detect marked targets with the phone camera, then shoot them down.

### Intake Shooter

This is a mechanical challenge. Design a robot that is able to pick up balls, then load them into a launcher, then shoot. Like the Shooterbot (from Introduction to Robotics), except much more versatile.

### Tower Builder

This challenge has mechanical and programming aspects. Design a robot to construct a tower from 4x4x8 inch blocks, and add a feature to enable it to automatically place blocks on an existing tower with the press of a button.
