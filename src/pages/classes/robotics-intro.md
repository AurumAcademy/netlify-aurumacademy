# Robotics Basics
Sensors, motors, and computers are just as fundamental to modern society as simple machines were to society a century ago. Introduction to Robotics will teach you about basic robot components and serve as a guide to bringing your creations to life. In it, we will explore how to integrate electronics into our designs, and use programming to control them.

### Pricing
More details are to come.
* $95 to rent
* $500 to buy
* $12-20 per child per lesson hour

## Curriculum
Each phase will span one to two weeks. Each week we will meet 3 times for an hour each.

### Phase 1 - Drivetrain

Learn about the different parts of our robot control system and use this to build a basic six-wheeled drivetrain.

### Phase 2 - Drivetrain Programming

Learn how to control your drivetrain from afar. Write a basic TeleOp for remote-controlling your robot, and a basic autonomous program to drive in a square.

### Phase 3 - Shooter

Build a flywheel shooter to launch wiffle balls. Program the shooter with fully and semi-automatic modes, and varying power levels.

### Phase 4 - Integration

Mount the shooter onto the drivetrain and combine both programs to give our drivetrain a weapon. 

### Phase 5 - Challenge

Modify and program your robot to complete an obstacle course both autonomously and remotely operated, then compete against your classmates to see who is the fastest.
