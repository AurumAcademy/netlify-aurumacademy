            This class is an introduction to our custom-developed Joynt build system, which Aurum uses for all hardware projects. In it, students will work their way up from building simple joints and hinges to creating a desktop-scale catapult and trebuchet!

            This class combines lessons learned in Mechanism Prototyping and Project Code to animate and control mechanical creations. Students will use Joynt to construct a six-wheeled drivebase and Android Studio to program it. We will then build and test a wiffle-ball shooting mechanism, and finally mount it to the drivebase.

            Cost: 25/hour

        Students will modify their robots themselves to complete one of three challenges, chosen by the student: constructing a tower, distinguishing a random pattern and responding to it, and <something that combines programming and building>.

We focus on mentoring students, rather than just teaching. We structure our virtual courses around giving students the tools to learn, explore, and create - on their own. Students are encouraged to work on their projects outside of online class time.
