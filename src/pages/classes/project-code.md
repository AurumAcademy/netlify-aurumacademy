# Project Code
This class builds upon the foundational knowledge of Programming Principles. In Project Code, the student will develop their own game/app! Project creation will be guided during lessons, and students will be encouraged (but not required) to work outside of lessons.

### Pricing
More details are to come.
* (TBD) $12-18 per child per lesson hour

## Curriculum (Tentative)

### Phase 1 - Planning and Designing
Think before you code! First we will set our goals and create a list of key features and brainstorm how they would be implemented.

Some ideas:
* idle/tapper game
* local play hangman
* text adventure/chatbot

### Phase 2 - Familiarizing with the environment
Students will choose their development environment and learn how to use the frameworks.

Recommended environments:
* pygame
* code.org
* repl.it

### Phase 3 - Creating
During sessions students will get guidance and input from teachers and peers.

### Phase 4 - Deployment
We will wrap up the creation process and learn how to export and deploy the product.

### Phase 5 - Presentation
We will hold a presentation session and share our creations with one another.

With permission, I will publish students' work to this website.
