# Bacyard Ballistics
Backyard Ballistics is a fun and accessible introduction to engineering focused on building tabletop-scale projectile launchers. Learn the basics of energy, structures, and kinematics through building three projects: a catapult, trebuchet, and crossbow. Build these three machines from Joynt, a kit of interchangeable parts developed by Golden Gears. (All projects will be indoors-safe)
