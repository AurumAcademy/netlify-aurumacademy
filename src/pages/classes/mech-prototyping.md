# Mechanism Prototyping
Simple machines - like gears, screws, pulleys, levers, and wheels - may seem basic, but form the foundation of modern society. Any one of them alone is nothing special. But engineering is about connecting them together, finding new and clever ways to create useful mechanisms from objects less complex. This class will teach you how to do that. The whole truly is greater than the sum of the parts.

## Curriculum
Each phase will span one to two weeks.

### Phase 1 - Introduction to Joynt - Structures

Learn about the basic components of Joynt, and how to connect them together to form rigid bodies. Build the 4 basic Joynt joints, then take what you’ve learned to construct a basic rectangular frame.

### Phase 2 - Introduction to Joynt - Moving Parts

Learn about gears, pulleys, ball bearings, and the concept of torque and mechanical advantage. Construct a basic gear reduction and use pulleys to create a block and tackle. Finish the week with a challenge to create a winch.

### Phase 3 - The Catapult

Use what we’ve learned so far to build a catapult. Learn about stored potential energy in the form of tension, and how it can convert to mechanical energy. Experiment with changing different parts of the catapult to launch a projectile maximum distance.

### Phase 4 - The Trebuchet

Use what we’ve learned so far to build a trebuchet. Learn about stored gravitational potential energy and how it can convert to mechanical energy.

### Phase 5 - Challenge

Use what we’ve learned so far to build your own kind of launcher! Or, modify a previous one. We will guide you through planning your design and making it a reality.
