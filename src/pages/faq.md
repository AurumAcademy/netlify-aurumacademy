### What happens if a class is missed?
We keep track of students' attendance. We can offer a make-up lesson for the hourly cost + $5, but it's best not to be absent!

Payment will be collected on the last Friday of each month.

### Can I get a discount?
If the student qualifies for free/reduced price meals at school, contact us and we can discuss an adjusted pricing plan.
