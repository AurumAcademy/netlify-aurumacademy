# Summer of Robotics
Sensors, motors, and computers are just as fundamental to modern society as simple machines were to society a century ago. Introduction to Robotics will teach you about basic robot components and serve as a guide to bringing your creations to life. In it, we will explore how to integrate electronics into our designs, and use programming to control them, through a hands-on robot building project.
 
### Pricing
* $250 tuition + robotics kit rental
* $345 tuition + robotics kit purchase
* If rented, option to "upgrade" and purchase kit at end of class for $95.

### Requirements
* A computer with a webcam and internet connection
* A medium-sized table area for building

## Curriculum (Tentative)
Each phase will span one to three days. We will occupy a regularly scheduled class period during the Learning Ladder camp, for a total of eight 35-minute sessions per week.

### Phase 1 - Drivetrain

Learn about the different parts of our robot control system and the Joynt build system, then use these to build a basic six-wheeled drivetrain.

### Phase 2 - Drivetrain Programming

Learn how to control your drivetrain from afar. Write a basic TeleOp for remote-controlling your robot, and a basic autonomous program to drive in a square.

### Phase 3 - Shooter

Build a flywheel shooter to launch wiffle balls (at indoor-safe velocities). Program the shooter with fully and semi-automatic modes, and varying power levels.

### Phase 4 - Integration

Mount the shooter onto the drivetrain and combine both programs to give our drivetrain a weapon! 

### Phase 5 - Challenge (time permitting)

Modify and program your robot to complete an obstacle course both autonomously and remotely operated, then compete against your classmates to see who is the fastest.
