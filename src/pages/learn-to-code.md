# Free Coding Class

Everybody is welcome, no matter your age or experience! There is no strict commitment required as well, so I encourage you to sign up if you have any interest. No previous knowledge or materials required, besides yourself and a computer! (Chromebooks OK!)

The first session of classes will run from June 29 to July 10 (2 weeks), and we will meet 3 times per week through Zoom. Hope to see you!
