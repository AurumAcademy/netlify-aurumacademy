# About Us

Aurum Academy is an online learning service. We focus on teaching fun, elective courses covering subjects not usually emphasized in traditional schooling, such as robotics, coding, and mechanical engineering. We use project-based learning to accomplish this.

Currently, we are run by two high-schoolers, Stephen Krider (12th) and Trinity Chung (11th). Stephen and Trinity played pivotal roles on the competitive robotics team Golden Gears, a community team run out of the Krider garage. Golden Gears has competed internationally and has achieved several state-level honors.

## History

The idea for Aurum Academy was born when we realized that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the accompanying quarantine, put a brief stop to all non-essential school programs, and put all essential school programs online. We believe that the quarantine is no reason to put a stop to these non-essential, but still enriching, electives - so why not bring them online, like all the rest?

## Methodology

Aurum Academy will host online class sessions several times per week using Google Hangouts, where one of our mentors will lead students in a particular project, specified in the course description. 

Online, coding-based projects are easy to work on remotely - but mechanical projects are not. Not everyone has access to a machine shop in their garage like Golden Gears! To overcome this barrier, Stephen designed a plastic build system (think industrial Legos) called Joynt, a collection of parts that can be assembled into all kinds of structures and devices. Aurum will sell and rent Joynt kits to build all projects necessary in a specific class.
